title: Understanding Logprobs in Large Language Models
---

When working with neural networks, especially in the context of language models, you might come across the term logprobs. Short for log probabilities, logprobs are probabilities expressed on a logarithmic scale. This approach is particularly useful in neural networks for several reasons.

**Why Use Logprobs?**
One of the main advantages of using logprobs is that they help mitigate the underflow problem. In a neural network, especially one dealing with a large vocabulary (e.g., 200,000 tokens), the probabilities for many tokens can be extremely small. These small probabilities might be rounded down to zero when represented by a machine, leading to inaccuracies. By using the log scale, we can represent these small probabilities more accurately, thus reducing the underflow problem.

**How Logprobs Are Computed**
To understand how logprobs are computed, it's essential to look at the workflow involving logits, probabilities, and logprobs. The process typically involves the following steps:

Logits: These are the raw, unnormalized scores output by the neural network.
Probabilities: The logits are passed through a softmax function to convert them into probabilities.
Logprobs: Finally, the probabilities are converted to log scale to get the logprobs.

**Applications of Logprobs**
Logprobs are incredibly useful in various applications, particularly in classification tasks. They provide a deeper understanding of how models make decisions and can be instrumental in evaluating and improving model performance. Despite their utility, many model providers do not expose logprobs through their APIs, or if they do, the functionality is limited. This limitation is often due to security concerns, as exposing logprobs can make it easier for others to replicate the model.

**Conclusion**
Understanding logprobs and their role in neural networks is crucial for anyone working with machine learning models. They offer a way to handle small probabilities more effectively and provide valuable insights into model behavior. As the field evolves, we can hope for more accessible and comprehensive logprobs APIs from model providers.
